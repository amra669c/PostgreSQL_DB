# SQL Practice Repository 🚀

This repository is designed to recap and enhance knowledge of SQL coding, with a focus on the PostgreSQL dialect. It includes examples and exercises that cover essential SQL concepts and commands, aiming to reinforce skills in both **Data Definition Language (DDL)** and **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**.

## 📂 Contents
- **DDL (Data Definition Language):**
  - Creating and modifying tables, schemas, and constraints.
  - Examples of `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP` statements.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):**
  - Writing queries to manipulate data, such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `SELECT`.
  - Practical use cases for filtering, joining tables, and grouping data.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts created as exercises for various database operations and analysis tasks. These scripts demonstrate:
- The creation, modification, and querying of databases and tables.
- Analysis of job postings and company benefits, showcasing practical data insights.

The codes in this repository are based on the online course by Luke Barousse, which can be found [here](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql). However, the code may not be an exact copy, as I made some adjustments and played around with the examples to explore and experiment further! ✨ This course is perfect for brushing up on your SQL coding knowledge in a very smooth and engaging way. 😄

## 📊 Data
The data used in this repository can be accessed via this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1egWenKd_r3LRpdCf4SsqTeFZ1ZdY3DNx). Feel free to download it and use it alongside the SQL scripts for hands-on practice.

This repository serves as a quick reference and practice tool for SQL coding, offering examples of common scenarios encountered in database management and querying. 📊

Feel free to explore, clone, and use these examples for your personal learning and development. Feedback and contributions are welcome to improve the repository further. 💡
